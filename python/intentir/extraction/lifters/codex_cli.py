_INITIAL_PROMPT = """You are the sole source-aware IntentIR Lift owner for this branch.
Work only under the isolated /workspace; input/ is immutable and output/, work/,
and tmp/ are writable. There is no repository or network.

Act like a coding agent, not a staged JSON generator. Start with the one compact
`source-brief` command in input/README.md, then read input/source.py. The brief includes
the complete compact Harness ABI ledger and exact Source/compiler navigation; you
decide all meaning. Query an exact compiler-observer section or TTIR slice only when
the current draft needs it. When Source or the brief exposes a fused operation or
explicit numeric extension/truncation, its focused TTIR query is mandatory before
authoring that typed numeric subgraph; never guess fused operand width from surface
operand declarations. Query schema leaves, operation contracts and ownership
terms through `python .agents/intentir_agent_tool.py lift_reference ...`; complete
references are deliberately not mounted as readable workspace files. Do not dump
input/source_ttir.json or broad reference material into the thread.

You alone author the complete output/candidate.json. J owns all logical semantics;
C owns only implementation choices; pi is only the typed Gate1 normalization
witness in the supplied schema. It has no realization graph. Author only closed direct
program/iteration/control/materialization/access-representation relations bound to
existing J axes, values, accesses and C slots. Query `realization-ledger` and the exact
pi schema leaves when needed; never copy a physical Source SSA id or target recipe into
pi. A relation whose fixed unary recognizer cannot prove remains hard.
Fixed code must not choose or fill any field, handle, relation, operation, or shape.
Preserve anonymous ABI order, parametric shape identities, logical control/time and
effects in J. Use dense declaration-ordered opaque handles and never copy Source
identifiers into the artifact.

Every inout tensor requires explicit pre-state access/effect, post-state access/effect,
and output_mapping. A static affine inout store is owned by that boundary access/effect
and an identity output mapping; do not invent semantic scatter/update nodes merely to
rebuild the full tensor. Use scatter only for a data-dependent J index whose closed
index/source shapes agree at the data rank. Treat the Harness grid as fixed U_f: do not
move a logical program coordinate to an absent launch axis. Preserve J access multiplicity; address recompute
relations may change pointer construction but never tensor, logical index, mask, value,
or effect. After J accesses exist, compare the ordered raw memory ledger with
`candidate-attachments`: when tensor root, transfer kind, ordinal, logical index,
predicate, and effect give a unique one-to-one correspondence, author the closed
`address_recomputed` row for that access instead of forcing one pointer spelling.

If output/candidate.json already exists, it is the exact preceding model-authored
candidate: read input/feedback_frontier.json and input/feedback_detail.json first, then
inspect and patch that candidate rather than recreating it. Otherwise write one meaningful
complete candidate early. Do not postpone authoring until after exhaustive reading. As
soon as the first complete JSON exists, run
`python .agents/intentir_agent_tool.py submit_candidate` before manual rereading or
broad TTIR/schema inspection. Let its closed diagnostics drive focused patches.
Organize scratch under work/ however useful. The final J/C/pi and every semantic
field remain entirely your work. This transaction first runs the source-free CandidateCheck and then the
reject-only necessary-condition SourceReconcile on the same exact bytes. Repair the returned diagnostics
and invoke it again. The host then runs the public Source-vs-J semantic probe on
those exact passing bytes and returns a same-thread diagnostic if they diverge.
That probe never certifies or edits the candidate: repair only when the evidence
shows your J is wrong, rerun submit_candidate, and leave small floating deltas or
unsupported execution as diagnostics. The host independently reruns Decode and
TypeCheck, then starts fresh source-blind Replay and the formal gates. Do not claim
certification.

_EXTERNAL_CONTINUATION_PROMPT = """The same branch-local source-aware Lift task continues in the same workspace and thread.
Read input/feedback_frontier.json first. Open only a named
input/feedback_category_NAME.json when its bounded frontier is insufficient; that
file contains the exact differences for the named category.
input/feedback_detail.json contains exact non-observer diagnostics. The previous
artifact already exists at output/candidate.json and is never duplicated in input.
After a formal Gate1 failure, only the bounded typed observer diff is returned.
The preceding Replay source, Replay TTIR, agent context, and implementation choices
remain hidden; repair J/C only when Source plus the typed frontier proves that the
current artifact is incomplete. Otherwise resubmit the unchanged artifact for a fresh
source-blind Replay.
Your own prior formal candidates are immutable under work/candidate_history/;
consult or restore them when a repair regresses, but decide every edit yourself.
Treat the first exact missing/extra operation only as an entry point: inspect its
typed Source-TTIR neighborhood and the bounded anonymous local frontier against the
current J node and boundary. The frontier describes a mismatch but does not expose
the Replay implementation that produced it. Preserve cast order and operation spelling when they are semantic. If J
already states the complete logical fact but Replay failed to realize it, do not add a
pi escape hatch; resubmit the unchanged artifact for a fresh source-blind Replay.
If independent fresh Replays vary only in addptr/address topology while the Source raw
memory ledger and current J access attachments have a unique tensor/kind/ordinal/index/
predicate/effect correspondence, that is precisely the closed
`access_representation_bindings.address_recomputed` case. Bind the existing accesses;
do not edit J semantics or encode a Source pointer recipe in pi.
Before editing local operations, check whether one omitted Source-visible loop,
effect_if, early terminal branch, continuation, or effect region explains the
downstream op/dataflow/predicate differences; if so, repair that complete J scope
rather than its symptoms. Change pi only when Source evidence and an existing J/C
anchor select one closed normalization relation; a row never licenses an arbitrary
diff. Conversely, when
the current J/B/C already authors the exact logical fact and Source-local boundary fact
but the preceding Replay alone failed to consume it, do not mutate the artifact to
imitate that Replay: resubmit the unchanged artifact for a fresh source-blind Replay.

compiler evidence, then revise the complete model-authored J/C/pi in place. If a
named relation's ownership is unclear, query only that term through

as a semantic patch. Run `python .agents/intentir_agent_tool.py submit_candidate`;
